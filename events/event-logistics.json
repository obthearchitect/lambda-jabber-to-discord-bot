Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.\n\n• What is space?\n• How do we get there?\n• Is warping there a possibility?\n• Can we get there through a wormhole?\n• Should we go?\n\nIn the last 24 hours we have seen facilities now being created for the greatest and most complex exploration in man's history. We have felt the ground shake and the air shattered by the testing of a Saturn C-1 booster rocket, many times as powerful as the Atlas which launched John Glenn, generating power equivalent to 10,000 automobiles with their accelerators on the floor.\n\nFC Name:‍‍‍‍ Captain Kirk \nFleet Name:‍‍‍‍ Star Trek \nFormup Location:‍‍‍‍ The Enterprise.\nReimbursement:‍‍‍‍ Peacetime \nComms:‍‍‍‍ Some Channel \nDoctrine:‍‍‍‍ Borg Fit.\n‍‍‍‍~~~ This was a broadcast from testBot to all at 2021-10-31 01:02:03.90210 EVE ~~~"
